# Gender-Based Violence Education Game

## Overview

In a world where every child deserves to feel safe and valued, our project aims to make a difference by educating young minds about gender-based violence through engaging gameplay. This interactive educational game is designed for 8-9 year olds, a crucial age when children start to understand their environment and relationships. By incorporating real-life scenarios and interactive quizzes, we strive to empower children with knowledge and confidence to recognize and respond to gender-based violence.

Through this game, we hope to create a safer future where children are not only aware of their rights but also equipped to make informed decisions. The game's immersive environments, from familiar school settings to the comfort of home, provide a safe space for children to learn about respect, kindness, and personal boundaries.

The journey begins with a captivating splash screen featuring a video introduction, setting the stage for the important lessons to come. As children navigate through the game, they will encounter thought-provoking questions and scenarios, designed to foster empathy and understanding in an age-appropriate manner.

Join us in this mission to educate and protect our future generation. Together, we can make a positive impact on the lives of children and help build a world where everyone feels safe and valued.
